Subject: [ANN] quickl 0.2.1 Released

Hi all!

quickl version 0.2.1 has been released!

* <http://github.com/blambeau/quickl>

Quickl helps you creating commandline ruby programs. From simple commands 
with options to complex delegators with subcommands, global and local options.

Changes:

# 0.2.1 / 2011.06.19

* Enhancements

  * Delegator delegates the command execution to an execute(argv) methods,
    therefore mimicing Single command
  * Command provides subcommand_by_name (a class method) allowing to resolve 
    ':' qualified command names easily. Robustness::has_command! has been
    rewritten to use the latter method, so that it now striclty respects command
    hierarchy  
  * Delegator.summarized_subcommands takes an optional argument, allowing
    to specify the list of commands for which documentation must be summarized. 
  * The factory methods Quickl::Command and Quickl::Delegator accept an optional 
    block which is yield with the command builder.
  * Command::Builder has a command_parent= accessor allowing to bypass the default 
    (infered) command strategy feature (advanced usage).
  * Command::Builder accepts callback blocks that are called when a command is 
    installed (advanced usage).

* On the devel side

  * The project structure is handled by ruby.noe 1.3.0
