Subject: [ANN] quickl 0.4.0 Released

quickl version 0.4.0 has been released!

Helper to create commandline ruby programs

* <http://github.com/blambeau/quickl>

Quickl helps you creating commandline ruby programs. From simple commands with 
options to complex delegators with subcommands, global and local options.

This release cleans internals as announced and may break your code if you didn't
cleanly upgrade from 0.2.x to 0.3.0. Quickl follows semantic versioning 
(http://semver.org/) and has not reached 1.0.0. Best effort is made to avoid 
breaking your code when upgrading the tiny version. You should require quickl as 
follows:

    gem "quickl", "~> 0.4.0"

Changes:

# 0.4.0 / 2011-08-15

* Enhancements

  * The hard-coded way of extracting command documentation as source rdoc has
    been replaced by a Command.doc_extractor (a Proc) which can be installed 
    through the command builder (advanced usage). Default behavior is kept 
    unchanged, though.
  * Command.documentation now takes an optional Hash of options, which is passed 
    as second argument to the documentation extractor (the first one being the 
    command class itself).
  * Quickl.split_commandline_args now accepts the separator on which splitting
    occurs as second argument.

* Breaking changes

  * Command#method_missing and well as the Robustness module have been removed
    after deprecation.
  * Command.doc_place and Command.doc_src have been removed as well.
