# 0.2.2 / TODO

* Enhancements

  * Added a template/delegator.erb template (quickl --layout=delegator ...)
  * Added --[no-]header and --[no-]footer options to the template generator

* Bug fixes

  * The gem is now shipped with the template/single.erb file. This fixes the 
    'quickl' commandline that generates skeletons as illustrated in README 
    (patch and thanks to Rit Li)
  * Broken links to the examples from the README are fixed (Travis Briggs)
  * Other typos fixed that led to failures on --help in examples (Tomasz Łoszko)

# 0.2.1 / 2011.06.19

* Enhancements

  * Delegator delegates the command execution to an execute(argv) methods,
    therefore mimicing Single command
  * Command provides subcommand_by_name (a class method) allowing to resolve 
    ':' qualified command names easily. Robustness::has_command! has been
    rewritten to use the latter method, so that it now striclty respects command
    hierarchy  
  * Delegator.summarized_subcommands takes an optional argument, allowing
    to specify the list of commands for which documentation must be summarized. 
  * The factory methods Quickl::Command and Quickl::Delegator accept an optional 
    block which is yield with the command builder.
  * Command::Builder has a command_parent= accessor allowing to bypass the default 
    (infered) command strategy feature (advanced usage).
  * Command::Builder accepts callback blocks that are called when a command is 
    installed (advanced usage).

* On the devel side

  * The project structure is handled by ruby.noe 1.3.0

# 0.2.0 / 2011-01-10

  * Added IOAccessError with default reaction to Exit
  * Added valid_read_file! robustness utility
  * Moved to rspec 2.4.0, modified Rakefile and tests accordingly
